# Specific project files to override
# ============

# Poetry is inconsistent with the way it generates files, so in some cases we
# have to force them to the correct line ending in the run script or the
# pre-commit hooks.  We don't bother doing that with poetry.lock, since its
# format is considered an implementation detail of Poetry itself.
